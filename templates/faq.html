  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <dl class=qa>
    <dt>What's the purpose of this website?
    <dd>
      <p>
        The guys from Mozilla did an experiment during the deployment of the
        Firefox 4 betas where they added a button into the toolbar with a
        happy and a sad face.  Upon clicking that button the user was taken
        to a website that asked him in less than 140 characters about their
        experience with Firefox.  Flask later implemented this at
        <a href=http://feedback.flask.pocoo.org/>flask-feedback</a>
      <p>
        While we cannot integrate that into Django in the same way because we do
        not have any kind of user interface that could accomodate such a button,
        we however encourage users to send us little messages about their
        experience with Django.   
    <dt>Why is this not on the main Django website?
    <dd>
      <p>
        For the very simple reason that this is an experient on its own and
        might be shut down without further notice.  We haven't done anything
        like that before and are not yet sure about the consequences.
    <dt>Will you censor here?
    <dd>
      <p>
        Unless hateful comments or spam end up on this website we will not
        remove any of them.  The raw data is available for everyone who is
        interested.
    <dt>Why does this website require JavaScript?
    <dd>
      <p>
        For the very simple reason that we currently use JavaScript as a simple
        method of preventing spam.  At least that is the motivation, if the
        efforts pay off we can't say yet.
    <dt>Is the source of this website available?
    <dd>
      <p>
        Indeed it is.  You can download it from github:<br>
